> Y: done
> X: doing
> T: todo

## Environment
1. Hardware
    - stm32-f4discovery
    - CH375 (USB Bus interface Module) [you need two, one for mouse, other for keyboard]

2. Develop Environment
    - Ubunutu
    - STM32CubeMX
    - openocd (For stlink debug progame)
    - gcc-arm-none-eabi
    - vscode (with Arm extensions)
